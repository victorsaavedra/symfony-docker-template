# Docker + PHP(8.3) + MySQL + Symfony (7.1)

This is just a skeleton I use for my own projects. The idea is to add more base functionalities in here.

- [X] PHPUnit
  - [ ] Coverage
- [X] PHPStan
- [ ] Behat
- [] PHP CS Fixer

## How to make it work

There's a Makefile, you just need to run:

```
make start
```

And it'll build the docker containers and start them. If you want to see more commands, just run:

```
make help
```
